AD控制板：
    SYNC    PA8 
    Active Low Input. This is the frame synchronization signal for the serial interface. While SYNC is low, data is
    transferred on the falling edge of SCLK. Data is latched on the rising edge of SYNC.    
    SCLK    PA9
    Serial Clock Input. Data is clocked into the shift register on the falling edge of SCLK. This operates at clock
    speeds up to 30 MHz.
    SDIN    PA10
    Serial Data Input. Data must be valid on the falling edge of SCLK.
    LDAC    PA11
    Load DAC, Logic Input. This is used to update the DAC registers and consequently, the analog outputs. When
    this pin is tied permanently low, the addressed DAC register is updated on the rising edge of SYNC. If LDAC is
    held high during the write cycle, the DAC input register is updated, but the output update is held off until the
    falling edge of LDAC. In this mode, all analog outputs can be updated simultaneously on the falling edge of
    LDAC. The LDAC pin must not be left unconnected
    CLK     PA12
    Active Low Input. Asserting this pin sets the DAC registers to zero-scale code or midscale code (user-selectable).
    SDO     PB15
    Serial Data Output. Used to clock data from the serial register in daisy-chain or readback mode. Data is
    clocked out on the rising edge of SCLK and is valid on the falling edge of SCLK.
